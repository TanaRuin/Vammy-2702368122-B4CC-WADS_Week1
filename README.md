What Is A Web Application?
-Every time you ‘do’ something online, you have used a web application. Be it online shopping, online banking, or web-mail. Web apps are essentially an application software that is stored on a remote server provided by a third-party and can be used directly from your browser, without having to download anything.

What is Web Application Development?
-Web application development is the process of using client-side and server-side programming to develop an application accessible over a web browser. Developers begin with ideating a web application based on finding a solution to a specific problem, and move on to design the app, choose the right framework to develop the web app, test it and finally deploy it.
