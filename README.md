# Web Application Development – The Definitive Guide for 2020

What Is A Web Application?
-Every time you ‘do’ something online, you have used a web application. Be it online shopping, online banking, or web-mail. Web apps are essentially an application software that is stored on a remote server provided by a third-party and can be used directly from your browser, without having to download anything.

What is Web Application Development?
-Web application development is the process of using client-side and server-side programming to develop an application accessible over a web browser. Developers begin with ideating a web application based on finding a solution to a specific problem, and move on to design the app, choose the right framework to develop the web app, test it and finally deploy it.

Web App vs Website – Is There a Difference?
-Yes, you’re right for asking that question. It is the first doubt that comes to mind and rightly so. The lines between a website and a web app are rather blurred.

Here’s the real difference. A website can be a static page shat only gives out information and may or may not have an input dependability.

A web app on the other hand is a dynamic web application that responds to user input and allows users to perform certain tasks over the internet.

So in short, any website that has client-side component that allows users to perform a task can be called a web app.

Web apps are designed to perform specific tasks that help user solve a problem. Websites can exist merely to provide information.

Web Apps vs Mobile Apps
Web apps can essentially be used over a browser on any device, be it a desktop or a mobile. So the real question here is – mobile web apps vs native mobile apps.

Native apps are platform specific applications build separately for Android or iOS devices. They need to be downloaded from an app store and stored on your device. While they offer a highly personalized experience, they are expensive to build, take up space on a device and are tied to that device.
