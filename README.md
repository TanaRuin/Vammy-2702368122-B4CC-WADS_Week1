# Web Application Development – The Definitive Guide for 2020

What Is A Web Application?
-Every time you ‘do’ something online, you have used a web application. Be it online shopping, online banking, or web-mail. Web apps are essentially an application software that is stored on a remote server provided by a third-party and can be used directly from your browser, without having to download anything.

What is Web Application Development?
-Web application development is the process of using client-side and server-side programming to develop an application accessible over a web browser. Developers begin with ideating a web application based on finding a solution to a specific problem, and move on to design the app, choose the right framework to develop the web app, test it and finally deploy it.

Web App vs Website – Is There a Difference?
-Yes, you’re right for asking that question. It is the first doubt that comes to mind and rightly so. The lines between a website and a web app are rather blurred.

Here’s the real difference. A website can be a static page shat only gives out information and may or may not have an input dependability.

A web app on the other hand is a dynamic web application that responds to user input and allows users to perform certain tasks over the internet.

So in short, any website that has client-side component that allows users to perform a task can be called a web app.

Web apps are designed to perform specific tasks that help user solve a problem. Websites can exist merely to provide information.

Web Apps vs Mobile Apps
Web apps can essentially be used over a browser on any device, be it a desktop or a mobile. So the real question here is – mobile web apps vs native mobile apps.

Native apps are platform specific applications build separately for Android or iOS devices. They need to be downloaded from an app store and stored on your device. While they offer a highly personalized experience, they are expensive to build, take up space on a device and are tied to that device.

Web apps on the other hand can be easily used on any device as they are accessed on a browser. They don’t take up device storage and most importantly, building a web app is more cost effective and viable.

Advantages of Web Application Development
As a developer, mastering web based application development opens up a wide array of opportunities for you. Every business today needs an expedient and cost effective solution for an application software that lets them reach out to users over any mobile or desktop device and every platform.

Web app development is platform agnostic so businesses don’t need to develop a separate app for iOS and android – something that directly doubles up the costs.
Web application technologies have advanced tremendously over the last few years, making web apps just as immersive and personalized as native apps.

Even businesses that already have highly popular native apps need an equally awesome web application as they cannot afford to alienate their web or desktop users. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, all have web apps at par with their native apps.
Knowing how to develop a web application puts you on top of a market comprising of top businesses that need a rich online presence.
